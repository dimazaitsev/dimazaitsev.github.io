</a></font>-
system of operative planning and management on the base of Petri net models</font></i></h3>
<i>Opera is intended for automation of processes of operative planning
and production managements on the basis of computer tools. Basic usage
of system - management of industrial activity at the machine-building (electronic
device building) enterprise. Application of system in other fields is possible
where it is necessary to provide effective execution of complexes of
the interconnected works on the limited resources. The model of object
of management is represented by timed Petri net.</i>

</a></font>-
system of modelling of processes and acceptance of decisions in CAM</font></i></h3>
<i>Nevod is intended for maintenance of the automated and automatic acceptance
of decisions in logic and organizational management systems.</i>
<br><i>The basis of architecture of system is made by the model of discrete parallel
processes in the form of Petri net - the modern world-wide recognized
mathematical tool.</i>
<h3>
<i><font face=" Times New Roman "><font color="#FF0000"><a href="softe.htm#sergo">Sergo
</a></font>-
the editor of electric circuits of the power substations</font></i></h3>
<i>Provides input, storage, updating and display of electric circuits of
the power substations, it is intended for creation of directory system.</i>
<br><i>It is possible to use Sergo as the editor in the systems which are carrying
out calculations under the electric circuits.</i>

asked: - What are you busy with? I am writing an opera, - I answered.</font></i>
<br><i><font face=" Times New Roman ">And before it I spent several of months in 
a production-dispatching department of  the Topaz plant,
literally absorbing realities of management process in products manufacturing;
 also I debugged system there - on our department there was no personal
computer for me. The system has two corner stones: the most up-to-date theory
- Petri net on A.I.Sleptsov, management - canbam on Yasuhiro Monden, heuristics
- on V.V.Shkurba and <a href="papersr.htm">something else</a>; and the
second </font></i>- <i><font face=" Times New Roman ">practice on V.S.Bolgarov,

- he has left to the supreme echelons of power. It has occured later the Motorostroitel
Corporation has got the Opera, but in those difficult postgraduate times
the contract with the Topaz from convincing submission of the chief of
the management information system department - not for kisses with them
to work, - allowed to keep on legs firmly. The Opera was born in 1990.</font></i>

history:
</font>Though the Opera is grandiose, but is too specialized, Petri is
universal, but toy; for a long time I wanted to write universal modelling system with 
a wide set of service functions. There
was no the one who would pay for it. . It hasnÂ’t been yet  allowed to corporate with
<a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pentagon%20/">the
Pentagon </a>. And A.I.Sleptsov has found
Minsk Woodprocessing Combine in the person of enthusiast Golenkevich, who
wanted to solve with the help of Petri nets the real task of power protection
management of the enterprise. And again from practice the necessary set
of service functions has grown. Golenkevich came to us, drew his huge networks,
started process of modelling, we added necessary code and corrected bugs.
The Nevod was handed over in 1992, everybody was pleased.</font></i>

result should be presented by the end of holidays. Sources of my libraries
have been transferred by bus, I made the project at night, programmed in the afternoon
in empty department of the factory. Had time. By the end of May they have
entered circuits of electro substations, I have added service and have
removed bugs.</font></i>

<br><i><font face=" Times New Roman "><font color="#0000FF">Some
history: </font>Anatoly Ilich Sleptsov, my supervisor of scientific studies,
has told, that Petri nets are so good, that even <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/pubs/pentagon/">the
Pentagon </a>began to use them for planning military operations, and with
occurrence of personal computers the magnificent opportunity to draw them
on the screen of the display has appeared instead of to enter as long heavy
matrixes </font></i>. <i><font face=" Times New Roman ">It was 1987, and in
the centre of retraining of teachers the first class of personal computers
Jamaha has appeared. Occasionally for some hours it was possible
to come there to develop the elementary modelling system. Soon the program allowed
not only to draw nets but also to model their dynamics. Then we photographed
networks from the screen of the computer for articles; funny. With occurrence of
Ã…Ã‘1840 and Nejrons texts were rewritten for IBM-compatible architecture.
And this process was financed by Korolyova Corporation for which computing structures
of the task of distributing of printed-circuit-boards and crystals were modelled.
Experience and wishes of those who worked with real models, were taken
into account in later development which could be named as software systems,
- the Opera and the Nevod.</font></i>

history: </font>Yes, the way to the protection of the dissertation was fascinating,
as an exit on the glide path: in May I had reported at a seminar of V.I.Skurikhin,
the text has written during the summer, till November it had been subtracted 
and corrected;
in November I had passed the examination on speciality in council and - the protection
in December. I have quickly cut out the author's abstract and has issued
it. Now posters. I have bought even feathers for ink and felt-tip pens. I have
drawn the first lines. Laziness! You see all this has been drawn already in figures
in the texts prepared in <a href="http://www.ouh.nl/open/eyn/chiappl.htm">ChiWriter

It is necessary to magnify only. And the width of the printer? Strips. To stick 
together from strips.</font></i>
<br><i><font face=" Times New Roman ">And at once I have run to the friend
of the childhood Sergey Khrapko on his department - there was not my own
computer near the hand. We have pulled out the documentation on the printer with graphics
codes, have looked through, chatted and during the evening we have written the
program which works. Then Sergey lead it up alone; I was on my glide
path. On the protection anybody else except me had not the posters drawn
on the printer. Notice, the program is virgin, as a new nucleus in RSX-11M;
and innocence of it is deprived with the first computer on which it is
started.</font></i>
