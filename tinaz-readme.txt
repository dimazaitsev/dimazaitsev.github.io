Model of Ethernet network with the common bus architecture.  
A linear structure parameterized with scaling parameter k - number of devices on a bus.


ECMA
----

[1], fig. A.1. 

Model of European Computer Manufacturer Association (ECMA) protocol. 
A deadlock is observed.


GRIDS
-----

[2], fig. 4, 6, 15, 16.

Models of grid structures: square on plane and hypercube.
A grid of switching nodes implements the packets delivery among attached on borders customer nodes, which send and receive packets.
Models are parameterized with scaling parameters: d - number of dimensions, k – size; other parameters define initial marking. 
C programs, which generate .net files for given values of parameters, are provided: sgen.c – generates a square grid, hcgen.c – generates a hypercube.
